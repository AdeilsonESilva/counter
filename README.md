## 🚀 Technologies
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) (CLI)
- [React Native Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/)
- [Moti](https://moti.fyi/animations)

I even used [RealmDB](https://realm.io/) but I didn't see the need so I decided to use [AsyncStorage](https://reactnative.dev/docs/asyncstorage).
